# Group chat based on TCP client/server communication
Group chat program, using  socket programming in C, where there is a single server and multiple clients. The server forwards a client's message to all the other clients. The communication between the server and the clients is based on TCP Client/Server Communication and multithreading.

Make a directory.
```
mkdir name_dir
```
Put server.c in the directory.
```
mv from_dir/server.c to_dir/server.c
```
Put client.c in the directory.
```
mv from_dir/client.c to_dir/client.c
```
Compile server.c program.
```
gcc server.c -o server.out -pthread
```
Compile client.c program.
```
gcc client.c -o client.out -pthread
```
Run the server.
```
./server.out  port_number
```
